1. New differentiable simulator for computational imaging
- relevant : papers that discuss differentiable simulations using fourier optics, ray-tracing, RCWA (also called Fourier Modal Method) or FDTD. Usually these papers also discuss joint-optimization between the system design and the processing algorithm
- not relevant : NA

2. New optical system / component for computational imaging
- relevant : system enabling hyperspectral acquisitions or depth estimation
- not relevant : system using acousto-optics or RF signals

3. Uses differential rendering for computational imaging
- relevant : combines imaging systems model and differentiable rendering pipelines
- not relevant : uses differentiable rendering for Neural radiance field or gaussian splatting

4. Describes self-supervised methods for computational imaging
- relevant : rendering pipelines used to train simulated or prototype imagers
- not relevant : papers on self-supervised methods regarding only the image processing stage

 In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers on optics, differentiable simulations and computational imaging.
 He does not want to read papers that are about primarily applications of methods to  specific domains.
